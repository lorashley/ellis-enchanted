There are a lot of great things you can DIY when it comes to your wedding. I decided that I would DIY my gifts to my Bridal Party!

For my lovely bridal party I handmade some cards with a finetip ink pen and watercolors! I actually was attempting to do the craft where you write in white crayon and watercolor over it, but the crayons i used were not working well *cough cough crayola*. So these were the end results, and I made envelopes with various sheets of beautiful scrapbook paper.
