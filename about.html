<p>Hello! I’m Lauren. By day I go by the title of imagineer (not affiliated to Disney Imagineers, nor have I proposed this 
title to my management) and by night I’d fall into the wife and mother of 2 (kitties that is). If you were to meet me, you 
would hear me say these things about myself (potentially multiple times. Yes, I am proud): 

<ul>
<li>South Florida native</li>
<li>Parents from Trinidad</li>
<li>Met my hubs in University</li>
<li>Home is now New England</li>
<li>Slowly evolving into a crazy cat lady</li>
</ul>

Ellis Enchanted refers to my home. But really it’s a space for everything inside and outside of the physical walls. I like to think that everywhere I go, it becomes a home to me, even if only in its brevity. Enjoy your stay.

<br><br>Sincerely, <br>
Lauren
