	<p>Hello! I’m Lauren. My husband, 2 kitties, and I live in Worcester, MA. Our favorite pastimes include traveling and eating.
	This blog will probably serve as a place for me to put house projects as well as arts and crafts. Aside from my coding day job,
	I am a student at Northeastern University. I will probably feature a lot of works that would hopefully become part of my 
	<a href="https://lorashley.github.io/">portfolio</a>.

	<p>Ellis Enchanted refers to my home. But really it’s a space for everything inside and outside of the physical walls. I like to think that everywhere I go, it becomes a home to me, even if only in its brevity. Enjoy your stay.
