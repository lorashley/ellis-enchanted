	<p>Hello! I’m Lauren. By day I go by the self-claimed title of imagineer (not affiliated to Disney Imagineers, nor have I proposed this 
	title to my management) and by night I’d fall into the wife and mother of 2 (kitties that is). If you were to meet me, you 
	would hear me say these things about myself (potentially multiple times. Yes, I am proud): </p>

	<p>Ellis Enchanted refers to my home. But really it’s a space for everything inside and outside of the physical walls. I like to think that everywhere I go, it becomes a home to me, even if only in its brevity. Enjoy your stay.
