        <p>For our anniversary we took a trip to Trinidad &amp; Tobago to visit my family and have some adventure time.</p>

<p>For our couples adventure we took a tiny plane over to the smaller sister-island of Trinidad, Tobago. 
In a nutshell I tell people that you visit Trinidad for family, food, and parties.
You visit Tobago to relax on the pristine beaches and lose track of the time.</p>

<p>So to walk you through our few days on the island: It started by renting a car. 
We chose to get an airbnb and explore the more untouched parts of Tobago (highly recommended). 
But, to my right-side of the road drivers - prepare yourself (mentally) if you plan on renting a car.
Maybe for the driving enthusiasts this would be no big deal, but to the average driver, I think driving through
the mountains on the opposite side of the road, in a country where their 2 way lanes are equivalent to a
single American lane… Prepare yourself. I would like to think I earned a mental badge of honor for keeping us alive.</p>

<p><em>From Taylor’s Rental Meet my Green Jeep (note: this is a Suzuki but in T&amp;T apparently everything is a ‘Jeep’ if it’s a 4x4):</em>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/144130979@N08/27568782452/in/dateposted-public/" title="jeep"><img src="https://c5.staticflickr.com/8/7198/27568782452_b0b55dc94b_b.jpg" width="960" height="720" alt="jeep" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
We didn’t have the absolute smoothest transition with the rental car company, but the man who helped us pulled through and got us situated as promised.
It could have been a lot worse, but it wasn’t!</p>

<h4 id="off-the-beaten-path">Off the Beaten Path</h4>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/144130979@N08/27669350105/in/dateposted-public/" title="parlatuvier"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7072/27669350105_47d31450ee_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="parlatuvier" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Tucked on a hill in Parlatuvier (2 hours north of the airport), we drove to our AirBnB in the national rainforest reserve, which created a truly unique experience. 
My mom was sure we were going to be kidnapped; when I travel her mind jumps to the film Taken. Also in retrospect, our car rental person told
me about his friend (a fisherman) getting kidnapped by Venezuelans for crossing into their waters, so maybe my mom isn’t completely off?</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/144130979@N08/27057362824/in/dateposted-public/" title="rainforestairbnb"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/8/7458/27057362824_88825a980c_b.jpg" width="960" height="720" alt="rainforestairbnb" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script><br />

<p>We had a huge house, definitely great value to bring my entire Trinidad family.</p>

<p>The downside to being in a remote area was lack of ability to get food. There were only tiny corner stores and one restaurant in our area.
After one night’s adventure for dinner 15 minutes south to <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g147392-d184392-Reviews-Castara_Bay-Tobago_Trinidad_and_Tobago.html]">Castara</a>, my obsession began.</p>

<p>While very touristy, <a href="https://www.castararetreats.com">Castara Retreats</a> was simply enchanting. They captured such a breathtaking view and you were basically enjoying a meal in an
expansive treehouse with all of nature surrounding you. As the sunset, the darkness was almost overwhelming.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/144130979@N08/27057362854/in/dateposted-public/" title="castarapano"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/8/7298/27057362854_7713b2f62e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="330" alt="castarapano" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><em>We had to have more of Castara.</em></p>

<p>The following day, we visited Englishman’s Bay and a few beaches, finally stumbling over to Castara again. The water was refreshing and the sun
was hot. As with most of our life, our activities were created based on our appetite. We knew Castara had some hidden restaurants, if only we could find them.
While swimming in our little bay we noticed there was a second one past some large rocks and mountains. If we were brave, we could swim.
We weren’t brave. So we found a walkable trail leading us to Heavenly Bay, a bay more mystical than the first. It was adorned with a local eatery (not 
sure if it was even the one we intended to go to).</p>

<p>While swimming with our go pro, a kind women asked if we had snorkled. Turns out we would meet two kind souls from Queens, NY (that feeling when
you meet an American abroad as if you were long lost friends). Dani and Joel showed us the ropes around snorkeling in Castara. I managed
to get the tiniest amount of video of it on my GoPro.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/144130979@N08/27061242763" title="snorkel"><img src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/8/7349/27061242763_e5bf6b0eb3_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="snorkel" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<em>Me trying to use a GoPro, FAIL</em></p>

<p>I <em>didn’t</em> manage to get the cute baby turtle we saw. For lunch we devoured octopus soup and drank our
rum punches on the water for the rest sun’s appearance. As the sun set, they showed us their cozy accommodations, to which we totally are 
doing next time. Shoutout to the curry goat we had at dinner too. Castara has my heart, I’ll be back for more.</p>

<p>The Tobago staples are Pigeon Point and Store Bay. Make sure you carry TT for the boat rides in Store Bay and bring your patience with you too.
The men running the boat are not concerned about the time as they try to pack as many people they can find on a boat. In the future I may 
try to hire my own boat or find something more local to get out to the ocean than their boats, but you have to do it at least once!</p>

<p>They take you to the <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g147392-d568971-Reviews-Nylon_Pool-Tobago_Trinidad_and_Tobago.html"><em>Nylon Pool</em></a> which is about 3 feet of glorious clear water in the middle of the ocean. Research it, go there.</p>

<p>For a nominal fee you can visit Pigeon Point and bask in it’s turquoise waters and have a photo op on the Jetty.
It was our last day in Tobago. We packed up from Parlatuvier before the sun rise to begin our 2 hour venture to the south western tip of the island.
Pigeon point is only a stones throw from the airport, contributing to it being a popular destination. In my true vagabond (as my mom calls me) self,
we bathed in the waters and just jumped on the plane back to Trinidad. Truly embracing the life I wanna live.</p>

      <p>
        <p>So, I’ve wanted to display my IG pics from our travels and with our friends and I decided I wanted to use a branch to hang them all.
Thankfully I got Nick to drive to a woodsy area of our neighborhood and grab me a fallen branch. I really wanted birch, but
I have no idea what we got (assuming maple?) but I liked it regardless.</p>

<h4 id="step-one-find-a-branch">Step ONE: Find a branch</h4>
<p>Did’t take pictures during the process. Learning that I should be taking pics for everything I do in case I’ll need them.
Our branch was like 5 feet long. I didn’t intend on doing such a long branch, but it worked out and I’ll tell you why!</p>

<h4 id="step-two-print-your-pics">Step TWO: Print your pics</h4>
<p>I didn’t get paid to promote this company by any means. But in case you want to recreate something like this, I did want to share
how awesome everything turned out from them. I ordered the <a href="https://www.socialprintstudio.com/minisquares/">minisquares</a>
from <a href="socialprintstudio.com">social print studio</a>. Other common printing places such as Walgreens and CVS only did
3x3 and larger (same for shutterfly). I wanted smaller pics due to how many I was using and 2x2 was perfect.</p>

<h4 id="step-three-assemble">Step THREE: Assemble!</h4>
<p>The items I used were: Branch, Twine, Pics, Mini Clothespins, &amp; Scissors - SO SIMPLE.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/144130979@N08/27603961576/in/album-72157669691115815/" title="Ellis Enchanted DIY Branch Photo Display Materials"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/8/7352/27603961576_22388f703c_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1365" alt="Ellis Enchanted DIY Branch Photo Display Materials" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>My original thought was to do 12 rows of vertical hanging photos (4 on each strand). But with the mini clothespins the 
string wasn’t really staying straight so I went with an alternate plan.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/144130979@N08/27360045440/in/album-72157669691115815/" title="Ellis Enchanted DIY Branch Photo Display Original Intentions"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/8/7049/27360045440_f54d1042ef_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1365" alt="Ellis Enchanted DIY Branch Photo Display Original Intentions" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I just strung the twine from one end up the branch to the other side,
letting it droop a bit just add the pics!</p>

<p>I knotted the twine around the branch for the long ones and we had two existing nails in the wall.
Despite those nails not being symmetrical at all - I used them where they were instead of creating new holes in the wall.</p>

<p>It turned out great for what we wanted.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/144130979@N08/27603922736/in/album-72157669691115815/" title="Ellis Enchanted DIY Branch Photo Display Close Up"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/8/7426/27603922736_005b6e5263_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1365" alt="Ellis Enchanted DIY Branch Photo Display Close Up" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/144130979@N08/27360393270/in/dateposted-public/" title="Ellis Enchanted DIY Photo Branch Display Final"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/8/7188/27360393270_518a40ce2e_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1365" alt="Ellis Enchanted DIY Photo Branch Display Final" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
Good thing I had the longer branch to host the display.
But any size branch should work for you!</p>

<p>Voilà!</p>

<p>Happy DIYing,<br />
Lauren</p>

        <p>While briefly living in Raleigh, North Carolina, my husband and I had a few fantastic bread puddings. I know bread pudding isn’t up
everyone’s alley - but it is DEFINITELY up our alley. While having brunch at a <a href="https://www.lafarmbakery.com/">french bistro</a> we 
had an amazing blue crab bread pudding. Unfortunately, they change their menu frequently and I never saw it again. Le sigh. 
The other one that resonated with us was a good ol’ southern bourbon bread pudding from a local microbrew in Durham near the UNC campus. 
We’ve dreamt about both since, but I have only recreated the latter. Here we go!</p>

<p>So I didn’t take step by step photos this time because it was the first time making it and I didn’t realize I was starting a blog.
It was dabomb.com and I plan on making it for an upcoming summer social I’m having for some colleagues and friends.</p>
